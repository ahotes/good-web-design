                        Websites have changed astronomically as the internet has been around, and over that span of
                        time, the principles of web design have drastically changed. What was passible website
                        design back in the mid 90's and early 2000's is, at this point, functionally burdensome and
                        visually antiquated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I researched web design principles from two sites I found on the internet, and based on what
                        I found, here are some websites that exemplify either <span class="green"><span
                                class="highlight">good</span></span> or <span class="red"><span
                                class="highlight">bad</span></span> design principles.

                        presentation, it clearly communicates its purpose, and it flows well. All of these things
                        are standards for good web design.</p>

                    <p class="grid-content">I consider Mozilla's Developer Network a well designed site because it

                    <p class="grid-content">Ling's Cars is a satirical website where the owner of the company "Lings
                        Cars" is using the site to advertise and sell cars of different types. The site itself
                        though is designed to be comedically flashy, chaotic, and a general eyesore to look at. Too
                        many animations and pictures moving all the time, as well as other excessive features are
                        present all over the site at all times.

                    <p class="grid-content">CraigsList is a general advertising forum for a variety of products and
                        services, generally within a certain geographic region. I would consider CraigsList to be an
                        example of bad web desgin (or at least antiquated), because its presentation doesn't make
                        its function immediately apparent, and isn't very user friendly!
